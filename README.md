Transport for London API Command Line Interface - TFL data + python + n00b + argparse module + me = funstuffs!

I decided to learn python because Darren Kitchen of Hak5 said It's awesome stuff.  I decided to check it out 
and, indeed, it's positively awesome stuff!  I only know a little of few languages - Javascript, Java, PHP and Autoit

I was watching a defcon talk on youtube presented by a guy who made a tool to map SCADA systems using the MODBUS
protocol that uses pythons option handling library so it works like nmap.  Somehow that leads to me wanting to 
check when my bus is going to arrive using the command line with flags and stuff.

Please try to excuse the commented code its overall not workyness :)
